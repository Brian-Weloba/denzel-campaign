        <h1>MANIFESTO</h1>
        <p>The following are some of the changes I intend to work on should I be elected by the Faculty of Science to
            represent them for the period of 2021/2022 as their chairperson.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I intend to emphasize on teachers taking more practical approaches in their lessons. This is so
                especially for lessons that may require coding or simulations. At the moment, most of the practical
                lessons are taught outside the computer labs which makes it difficult for students to make use of their
                laptops to follow up practically. I’d advise that the lecturers also take advantage that almost each
                student has a laptop of their own which would then help in ensuring each one of them could take part
                actively in the practical classes. This would also help solve the problem of the few computers present
                in computer labs.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I also plan on campaigning for funds to be allocated to the faculty so as to enable the faculty to be
                furnished with equipment such as Arduino kits (Essential in boosting student’s awareness on the emerging
                Internet-of-things). On the same note, the faculty could also be equipped with a few high-end computers
                to allow for students to use them in coming up with technological and other science projects that could
                boost our prowess in the field of sciences. This has been the action taken in other major universities
                to market themselves to the outside world and also equip their students with skills necessary for the
                job market. One example of such a scenario is Kenyatta University which had 8 of its students launching
                Kenya’s first satellite to space.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>I intend to make the learning process one that will also be enjoyable rather than one that only takes
                place behind desks. This will be done by introducing events such as Mathletics and Hackathons in which
                Faculty members may take part while showcasing their skills while also learning a thing or two from each
                other
            </li><br>
            <li>I’d also like to work on requesting the school to furnish the school with lecturers who can take us
                through the semesters without missing out on many lessons. Recently, we’ve had lectures of some lessons
                commencing as late as one month after the semester kicks off. It would also be good to having our
                lecturers covering units related to emerging content. One example would be the lecturers making more use
                of Python and Java languages in their classes rather than C and C++ which are languages that aren’t
                frequently used anymore. This will help students from the faculty keep up with developing feats in
                science.
            </li><br>
            <li>I would also humbly request for one of the dormant rooms to be converted into a science room where
                students from the faculty of science can interact with computers and other gadgets while getting to
                learn how they work. Initially one such room was the Computer Maintenance room which was then converted
                to a lecture room. Such a room would also be perfect for showing off exhibitions of work done by the
                faculty of science students. This could motivate a keen interest in key areas such as robotics and
                artificial intelligence among others.
            </li><br>
            <li>The fact that we have students amongst us who may have also taken part in short courses hence they are
                equipped with certain practical skills that could be essential in tackling some science issues should be
                considered as an advantage. Some of the courses taken are Web Development, Ethical Hacking and
                Information Security and Android Application development. Students with such skills can be approached by
                fellow students in order to also learn the same skills and in turn pass it on to other students who’ll
                join later on.
            </li><br>
            <li>I plan on working with fellow students who are willing to help come up with an android application that will
            be well stocked with features to help Catholic University – Gaba students access school services more
            efficiently. Such services include Timetable reminders, lesson notices especially in case of any changes,
                fee payment and other necessary features.</li><br>
            <li>I would also ensure that the faculty acquires a Hard disk which will be filled with programs such as MATLAB,
                Eclipse, Android Studio and other application programs necessary for the course. These programs can then be
                easily distributed to the students’ computers in case they are needed for their classes.
            </li><br>
            <li>I’d also like to organize for the ICT Department to pick one student who’ll in turn pick other students in
                each class and cohort to help in ensuring the computer lab’s peripherals are well looked after during
                lessons in order to minimize on cases of the peripherals being stolen during lessons.
            </li><br>
